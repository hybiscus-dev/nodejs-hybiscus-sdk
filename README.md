> NodeJS SDK for interacting with the Hybiscus API

## ðŸª› Requirements
- NodeJS 12.X or newer

## ðŸ›  Installation
The library can be installed via `npm` as follows:

```shell
$   npm install @hybiscus/web-api
```

## ðŸš€ Usage
The NodeJS SDK provides a declarative API for building up the report and the components inside it. Below is a simple example to get you started:

> **Note** To use the Hybiscus API, you require an API key which you can get by signing up at [https://hybiscus.dev/signup](https://hybiscus.dev/signup) with a **Forever Free** plan. For more details on plans, see [here](https://hybiscus.dev/plans).

### Quick start

```js
const { HybiscusClient, Report, Components } = require("@hybiscus/web-api");
const { Row, Section, Table } = Components;

const section = new Section({ sectionTitle: "title" }).addComponents([
    new Row({ width: "2/3" }),
    new Row({ width: "2/3" }).addComponents([
        new Table({
            title: "Table title",
            headings: ["URL", "Page views"],
            rows: [
                ["google.com", "500"],
                ["bing.com", "50"],
            ]
        }),
    ]),
]);
const report = new Report({
    reportTitle: "Report title",
    reportByline: "The byline" 
}).addComponent(section);

const client = new HybiscusClient(process.env.HYBISCUS_API_KEY);
client
    .buildReport({ report })
    .then((response) => {
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

The Promise returned by `client.buildReport` resolves to an object, which contains the URL for the generated PDF. The object is defined by the following interface:

```ts
interface IPDFReport {
    url: string | null;
    taskID: string | null;
    status: "SUCCESS" | "FAILED" | "RUNNING" | "QUEUED";
    errorMessage: string | null;
}

```

### Components
Classes are available for each of the components in the Hybiscus API. All component classes follow the same basic principle, initialise the component class using the options that are specified in the [API docs](https://hybiscus.dev/docs/components/section). The only difference with the TypeScript / NodeJS library is that instead of using `snake_case` formatting for the names, the names are changed to `camelCase`

Components which are specified as extendable in the API docs, have the optional method `.addComponents` or `.addComponent`, which you can use to add components within them. Components can be deeply nested through this way, giving a lot flexibility.

```js
const { Components } = require("@hybiscus/web-api");
const { Section, Text } = Components;

const section = new Section({ sectionTitle: "title" })
    .addComponents([
        new Section({ sectionTitle: "Sub-section" })
            .addComponents([
                new Text({ text: "Example text" }),
                new Text({ text: "More example text" }),
            ]);
        new Section({ sectionTitle: "Sub-section" })
            .addComponents([
                new Text({ text: "Example text" }),
                new Text({ text: "More example text" }),
            ]);
    ])
```

This forms part of the declarative API, which lets you define the report contents without worrying about layout and design, and focusing on content.

### Client
The client `HybiscusClient` is initialised with your API token. Two functions are available which correspond to the 2 API endpoints:

- Build report (`.buildReport`)
- Preview report (`.previewReport`)

The `.previewReport` function generates a low resolution JPEG preview of the report, which doesn't count against your monthly quota.

Both functions accept either an instance of the `Report` class for the
`report` parameter, or an object in the `reportSchema` parameter, which
has the report defined according to the [API documentation online](https://hybiscus.dev/docs/components/section).

```js
const { HybiscusClient } = require("@hybiscus/web-api");

...

const client = new HybiscusClient(process.env.HYBISCUS_API_KEY);
client
    .previewReport({ report })
    .then((response) => {
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

### Using a custom HTTP client
By default Hybiscus will use native `fetch`, falling back to `cross-fetch` if no native implementation is available. You can use an alternative fetch implementation by passing an instance of it as the second argument of the `HybiscusClient` constructor. This client must support the Fetch API.

```js
const nodeFetch = require("node-fetch");
const client = new HybiscusClient(process.env.HYBISCUS_API_KEY, nodeFetch);
```

## ðŸ“– Documentation
Documentation can be autogenerated using `jsdoc` by running `npm run doc`. This will generate HTML documentation in the `docs/` folder which can be viewed directly in a browser without the need for a web server.
